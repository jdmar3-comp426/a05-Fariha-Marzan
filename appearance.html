            <h1> Appearance of Hel </h1>
            <p>
                Hel has an appearance of half a pale woman and a skeleton. The human side of her body provides an understanding of death and how closely it relates to life. She promotes the idea that death is an idea that we should accept rather than being something scary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hel is usually calm and dressed in a long black robe. As she makes a hand gesture, she extends her skeleton part of her body. This is a test to see how receptive the person is to the unusual part of her body.
