            <p>
                In Norse mythology Hel is originally the name of the world of the dead. Afterward, it became known as the goddess of death. Hel, the goddess of death, was one of the children of the god Loki. She was cast out of Asgard by Odin and sent to Niflheim.

                Niflheim is the land of the dead ones who died without glory. She was set as the queen of Niflheim and her kingdom was known to lie downward and northward.
